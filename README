MapIt launches a browser pointed to maps.google.com with whatever text is in your clipboard when you run it.

This way, you can copy an address from an email or web page, and (in Windows) hit Win+R, type "mapit" and then a Google Map of the address will automatically open up.

The clipboard functionality comes from my other project pyperclip.py https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip

Works on Python 2 and Python 3. Works on Windows, and should work on Mac and Linux as well.

You can also run "mapit.py <enter address here>" from the command line, rather than use the clipboard.
